# VxMail Product Spec

## Background & Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant challenge to the US General Election of 2020. How can we safely hold elections when it may be unsafe to congregate in a typical precinct? There is an emerging consensus that one important solution will be the expansion of vote-by-mail.

Our product hypothesis is that, in states that currently have little vote-by-mail, the small-to-medium sized counties that process no more than 50,000 votes are likely to have the hardest time making the necessary adjustments. Many of those counties are lightly staffed, and many have a completely manual process for processing absentee ballot requests, stuffing and mailing ballots out, and finally receiving, sorting, verifying, extracting, and scanning the returned ballots. A manual process that works for a few hundred ballots quickly falls over for a few thousand ballots, and establishing a more automated process in the 6 months we have left is a huge challenge for each small county to undertake.

We propose VxMail, a set of tools to help small counties quickly scale up their vote-by-mail capacity.
