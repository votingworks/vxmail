# VxMail Product Spec

## Background & Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a new and significant challenge to the 2020
General Election in the United States. How can we safely hold elections when it may
be unsafe to congregate in a typical precinct? There is an emerging
consensus that one important solution will be the expansion of
vote-by-mail.

## Key Hypothesis

Today, many small and some medium-sized counties have a sufficiently
manual process for a relatively small number of vote-by-mail
ballots. COVID-19 will require those counties to process 10 times more
ballots, making the manual process no longer practicalâ€”because of
insufficient speed and accuracy. With simple, readily available
off-the-shelf hardware and robust software, we can enable 3 election
staffers to handle 50,000 vote-by-mail ballots assuming at least 4
weeks for sending out ballots prior to election day and 2 weeks for
tabulation.


## VxMail

We propose VxMail, a set of tools to help small counties quickly scale
up their vote-by-mail capacity.

### Components

VxMail includes:
* a Ballot Manager to send mail ballots to voters, log receipt of those ballots, and verify signatures.
* tools to efficiently open envelopes and extract ballots.
* a Ballot Tabulator to scan and tabulate ballots.

The Ballot Manager works online for connecting with print-and-mail
services, and potentially to the state's Election Management
System. The Ballot Scanner is offline for security purposes.

### Printing and mailing ballots

The VxMail Ballot Manager lets an election official:

* upload the election definition
* upload the voter mailing list
* proof generated ballots on screen
* order those ballots printed and mailed, with a 3-day in-USPS-hands SLA
* track ballot delivery to voters.
* track ballot return from voters.

All ballot printing, stuffing, and mailing is managed by VotingWorks
and its partners, while election officials can track that process via
the Ballot Manager. Voters receives a ballot and return envelope,
including, as per best practices, a clear location to sign printed on
the return envelope.

### Verifying voter signatures

When ballots are received, election officials can verify ballot
envelope signatures using the VxMail Ballot Manager, which includes an
envelope scanner:

* An export of voter IDs and signatures, provided by the state, is
  loaded into the VxMail Ballot Manager
* Ballot envelopes are scanned into the Ballot Manager in small
  batches. On screen, expected and actual signatures are displayed for
  confirmation by election officials. If election officials detect any
  mismatch on screen, they indicate this with a single tap on the
  corresponding button, and the scanning process pauses while election
  officials locate and set aside that ballot envelope. VxMail records
  digitally that this envelope was rejected. Scanning ballot envelopes
  continues, one small batch at a time.
* When all ballots have been scanned, the VxMail Ballot Manager
  produces an export of successful and unsuccessful voter IDs,
  including digital images for both sides of the corresponding ballot
  envelopes. These can then be upload into the state voter management
  system to record that those voters have cast a ballot.
  
If the integration with the state's voter IDs and signature files is
not an option, election officials may instead use their existing
Election Management System and look up voter records as ballot
envelopes come in, either by scanning a voter ID barcode that appears
on the ballot return envelope, or by manually looking up the voter
record.

### Opening envelopes and extracting ballots

Depending larger counties, VxMail includes an off-the-shelf automatic
envelope opener and letter extractor, reducing the personnel needed
for opening ballots. For smaller counties, VxMail includes an
affordable automatic letter opener.

### Scanning and tabulating ballots

Extracted ballots are tabulated via the VxMail Tabulator, which
includes a physical scanner and an accompanying laptop. Three scanner
models are available depending on the county size:

* small: up to 10,000 ballot pages per day, in batches of 50, each batch taking 1 minute to scan.
* medium: up to 45,000 ballot pages per day, in batches of 300, each batch taking 3 minutes to scan.
* large: up to 120,000 ballot pages per day, in batches of 500, each batch taking 3.5 minutes to scan.

The VxMail Tabulator produces a set of CVRs and a tally of those CVRs.

### Maintaining an accurate pollbook

Election officials can use VxMail to ensure that each voter casts no
more than one ballot. At the very least, the VxMail Ballot Manager's
list of voters who have cast a ballot, when reconciled against the
State voter registration system, will flag any voter that may have
cast a ballot both in person and by mail. Election officials that want
stronger protection have a choice of two options:

- connecting the VxMail Ballot Manager to the State Election
  Management System for live information on which voters have voted in
  person.
  
- reconciling the VxMail Ballot Manager received-ballot list with the
  Election Management System on a nightly basis, leaving ballot
  envelopes unopened until the next day once those voters have been
  confirmed not to have voted.

## Future Components Under Consideration

VxMail may include additional components based on the needs we hear from states and counties:

* an online absentee ballot request system to let voters request an absentee ballot.
* a mail-and-SMS-based signature cure process, where invalid signatures can be remedied efficiently.

## Cost

Our rough estimate of complete equipment system cost is:

* Small: $3,500
* Medium: $7,000
* Large: $15,000

Plus, for ballot printing and mailing: $1.75 per voter, not including return postage.
